# Pokedex Documentation Content

Documentation in Markdown format, and Obsidian configuration files for the Pok√©dex project.  

## Important

This is a submodule for the [Pokedex Documentation Framework](https://github.com/Kanto-Pharmaceuticals/pokedex-documentation-framework) and should be reviewed before being pushed to documentation framework build.  Content can be updated in the framework repo using `yarn update`.  It is important to have some knowledge of working with `git` and `submodules` in CLI in order to avoid breaking pointer references.
